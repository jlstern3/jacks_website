                <p>At Cedar & Crow our mission is to reconnect with our ancient ancestors and relearn the skills and 
                    practices that allowed them to survive and <em>thrive</em> in their time. By learning these skills, our aim 
                    is to make humans "wild" again. In this modern world we rely on so much modern technology that most 
                    of us have forgotten how proficient and capable we are in the natural world. By becoming what we like 
                    to call a "Wild Human" you will learn to be confident and proficient in the skills it takes to survive 
                    and thrive in the wilderness, as well as develop an appreciation for the natural world that very few 
                    people get to experience today.</p>

                <p>
                    After attending every major naturalist school in the state of Washington, Jack Batteiger (Cedar & Crow Founder and Educator), 
                    has experienced the best of what these schools have to offer and identified ample room for improvements.
                    Jack saw education getting watered down, and educational courses omitting important advanced skills and even essential basic skills. 
                    To combat the erasure of vital naturalist knowledge and wilderness skills, Cedar & Crow was born!</p>
